# Work-Day-Schedule

## Description

-I wanted to create a calendar for my work day throughout class to better organize my tasks and see how long different tasks took me to complete.
-Integrating third-party API libraries was a fun chalenge to work with and parsing through the data was chalenging but fun to see how I can use different ways to code.
-I was grateful for my classmates because they helped me get my thoughts in order to figure out how I wanted to work through this challenge.
-I was also grateful to the tutor I used, Samuel Corova, because he was helpful in showing my that I was backwards in how I was assigning the future, past, and present classe as well as helping me realize that I was trying to GET my local storage before I even SET it.
